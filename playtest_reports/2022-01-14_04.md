cool mechanics

explanation is extremely clear
flashing spacebar

options & abilities:
- moving
- dashing through the walls
  - charge it up to get longer distances

learn basic controls:
- through the very informative tutorial

level's goal:
- jump over the walls and reach the end

explain rules:
- dash over solid terrain

why two walls:
- one is bigger than the other, so you need a longer dash to make it over the second one than the first one

next part:
- enemies that are going to shoot or hit you and more of these walls with different sizes

surprised:
- n/a

frustrated/bored:
- n/a

charge up dash and no moving makes it past the first wall

add indicator that you have to move while dashing to make it across

very original, haven't seen anything like this for the game design class yet.
