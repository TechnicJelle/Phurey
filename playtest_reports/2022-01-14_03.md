what options & abilities:
- movement
- dashing

how learn basic controls:
- looking at what's on the screen and trial and error

- dash through the two walls

next part:
- enemies
- more obstacles

surprised:
- n/a

frustrated/bored:
- in front of thin river, long press takes you into the wide river and you get set back to in front of the first river
- confusing that obstacle is thinner in some places than others visually, but not in the actual collision
